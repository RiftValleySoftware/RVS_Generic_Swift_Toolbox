# ``RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox``

A Set of utilities to ease basic and repetitive tasks, in Swift.

## Overview

This repository is an Xcode project with a set of ambidextrous (That's what I really mean by "generic"; not just using generics) tools that can be applied to Swift projects deployed for [iOS](https://apple.com/ios), [iPadOS](https://apple.com/ipados), [MacOS](https://apple.com/macos), [WatchOS](https://apple.com/watchos) and [TVOS](https://apple.com/tvos).

These tools will work for all of these platforms, and will, at most, rely only on [the Foundation library](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation), and [the Core Graphics types (in the Core Foundation Library)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation).

- [**COLLECTION TOOLS**](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox/tree/master/Sources/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox/Collection%20Tools)
    - [**RVS_FIFOQueue**](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox/blob/master/Sources/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox/Collection%20Tools/RVS_FIFOQueue.swift)

        This is a high-performance generic FIFO queue data structure. It's based on the work of [Ole Begemann](https://oleb.net), who used it as an example in his [Advanced Swift](https://oleb.net/advanced-swift/) book.
    - [**RVS_SequenceProtocol**](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox/blob/master/Sources/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox/Collection%20Tools/RVS_SequenceProtocol.swift)
    
        This is a simple protocol that gives classes and structs that conform to it, some basic [Sequence](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sequence) behavior.

- [**DEBUG TOOLS**](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox/tree/master/Sources/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox/Debug%20Tools)
    - [**RVS_DebugTools**](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox/blob/master/Sources/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox/Debug%20Tools/RVS_DebugTools.swift)
    
        This is a set of tools used to aid debugging and testing code.

- [**EXTENSIONS**](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox/tree/master/Sources/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox/Extensions)
    - [**RVS_Int_Extensions**](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox/blob/master/Sources/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox/Extensions/RVS_Int_Extensions.swift)
    
        Extensions to integer data types, as well as some degree/radian conversion for floats and doubles.
        
    - [**RVS_String_Extensions**](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox/blob/master/Sources/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox/Extensions/RVS_String_Extensions.swift)
    
        Extensions to the [StringProtocol protocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/stringprotocol). These are mostly parsing, filtering, and conversion capabilities.
        
    - [**RVS_Foundation_Extensions**](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox/blob/master/Sources/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox/Extensions/RVS_Foundation_Extensions.swift)
    
        Extensions to the [StringProtocol protocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/stringprotocol). This adds some significant capabilities, such as [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5)/[SHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms)-hashing, substring searching, simple localization, and basic parsing.
        
        Extensions to the [Date Struct](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/date/). This makes Dates [strideable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/strideable/). It also allows "coarse" date comparisons, using a "granularity" of 24 hours (one day).
        
        Adds degree/radian conversion to [CGFloat](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cgfloat/).
        
        Adds rotation support to [CGPoint](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cgpoint/).

## Usage

### [**Swift Package Manager (SPM)**](https://swift.org/package-manager/)

You can use SPM to load the project as a dependency, by referencing its [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox/) URI (SSH: [git@github.com:RiftValleySoftware/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox.git](git@github.com:RiftValleySoftware/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox.git), or HTTPS: [https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox.git](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox.git)).

Once you have the dependency attached, you reference it by adding an import to the files that consume the package:
    
    import RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox
    
All of the extensions and utilities will be available.

### [**Carthage**](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

Carthage is probably the "lowest-overhead" way to use these tools. It's extremely simple to use, and squeaky clean. You will only need to include references to the files into your project.
You implement it by adding the following line in your [Cartfile](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md):

    `github "RiftValleySoftware/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox"`
    
Once you have done this, navigate the Terminal to the directory containing the Cartfile, and execute:
    
    `carthage update`

This will result in a directory, at the same level as the Cartfile, called `Carthage`. Inside of that directory, will be another directory, called `Checkouts`. Inside of that directory, will be a directory called `RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox`.
The files that you are looking for will be in the `Sources/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox` directory. They are arranged in the grouping they are documented, above.

Just drag those files into your Xcode project, and add them to the appropriate targets.

If you choose to use the build products, be aware that Carthage builds may not always sign the modules, so you could have issues submitting to the app store.
    
### **[Git Submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)**

You could also directly include the project as a Git Submodule. Submodules can be annoying to work with, but are a good way to maintain ironclad version integrity.
If you do this, then you should do the same as above, but instead of a Carthage directory, you will have whatever directory you choose to use to place the submodule.

## Requirements

These utilities require [the Swift programming language](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), along with [the Foundation Library](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation) (it also uses [the Core Foundation Library](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation), which, for some reason, is treated separately, in iOS).

> **_NOTE:_**  Because of the intricacies of accessing [the main bundle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/bundle/1410786-main), in [`XCTest`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest), the [`localizedVariant`](https://riftvalleysoftware.github.io/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox/Extensions/StringProtocol.html#/s:Sy25RVS_Generic_Swift_ToolboxE16localizedVariantSSvp) and [`accessibilityLocalizedVariant`](https://riftvalleysoftware.github.io/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox/Extensions/StringProtocol.html#/s:Sy25RVS_Generic_Swift_ToolboxE29accessibilityLocalizedVariantSSvp) computed properties are not covered in the auto-test. This is OK, as they are used by every project I write, so they receive a _lot_ of testing.
